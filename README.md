# AVO Explorer v3

This is a porting of my old [AVO Explorer notebook](https://github.com/aadm/avo_explorer).

It does not have all the features of the old version because I have used Streamlit to pack it as an app, and Streamlit kinda forces you to use Altair for visualization (and I don't know Altair so well as matplotlib).

However I managed to pack it all in a few hours; consider it as a work in progress.

To launch it as an app, click here: <https://avo_explorer_v3.streamlit.app>
